## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned
- One of the problems I had was making the image and the text same size when using flex. I learned using flex-basis to get the result.

### Continued development
- I want to work on the animation of the card. When there is transition between desktop and mobile it transitions smoothly but not in a controlled manner. I want to learn animating the card so it is presented in a beautiful way.
